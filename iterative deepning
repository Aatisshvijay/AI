5. Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS): Runway Allocation
Narrative: Planes landing at an airport are assigned runways incrementally based on availability and priority.

Solution Approach:

Algorithm: IDDFS is useful here because it systematically searches for available runways while controlling depth.
State Space: Nodes represent runway states (available or occupied), and transitions represent landing assignments.
Implementation Steps:
Start with a depth limit of 1 and perform Depth-First Search (DFS).
If a solution is not found, increase the depth limit and restart the search.
Continue until a valid runway allocation is determined.
Prioritize high-priority flights (e.g., emergency landings).
Challenges & Extensions:

Challenges:
Avoiding assigning the same runway to multiple flights.
Balancing runway utilization and minimizing delays.
Extensions:
Introducing dynamic runway closures, forcing recalculations.
